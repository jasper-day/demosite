This is a demonstration website meant to show the possibilities of
- In-browser 3D rendering for models and crystal lattices
- Static site generation with Github markdown (the simplest method)
- Cross linking and referencing

# The demonstration website has moved: go to [jday.systems](https://jday.systems)

[Comparison of different site generators](comparisons/overview.md)\
[My goals and thoughts for the MatLib project](thoughts/goals.md)\
[Demonstration with 3D model](demo/model.md)\
[Demonstration with crystal lattice](demo/lattice.md)
