# Project goals

- Create a resource that is accessible to *anyone, from any discipline*, who wants to learn about how materials are used in the real world
- Create a resource that will be directly useful to the student teams at the uUniversity
- Aggregate all the (rather confusing and opaque) open-source materials data on the internet and create clear guides on how to utilise them in material design and selection, motivated by physical examples
- Create a beautiful, inyteractive, and well-documented website
- Integrate the online and physical experience of the materials library
- Empower and encourage students to learn more about the wonderful world of materials!

# Personal development goals

- Learn new website development techniques and apply standards for documentation
- Apply coding and automation skills (bash and python) to reduce repetitive work
- Practice making efficient and lasting designs for the physical library itself
